## Limitations

Our Product Increment 1 (MVP) of WellNest has the following limitations:

1. **Matching with Therapist Feature**: 

    - **Simulated Google Workspace Integration**: Our current implementation of WellNest, the user cannot integrate with Google Workspace. Instead, we will operate in simulated environment and provide the user with a pre-determined time and date for the appointment with the matched therapist.  
    - **Absence of Algorithmic Matching**: At present, WellNest doesn't employ sophisticated algorithms for matching therapists. Instead, it just matces the user with a pre-determined list of therapists.  
    - **No Database Storage Functionality**: As of now, WellNest doesn't possess the functionality to store matched therapist data in a database. Hence, the user cannot retain or retrieve information of upcoming appoitments and therapists they have been matched with!  

2. **Mood Tracking Feature**: 

    - **No Sharing Mood Data on Third-Party applications**: Currently, WellNest doesn't allow sharing mood data with third-party applications. Instead, teh system will only notify the user that the mood data is successfully shared to simulate the behavior of sharing the mood data through a third-party application!
    - **No Database Storage Functionality**: At present, WellNest doesn't possess the functionality to store mood data in a database. Hence, the user cannot retain or access historical mood information.

3. **Play to Earn Feature**: 

    - **No Database Storage Functionality**: At present, WellNest doesn't possess the functionality to store rewards earned throught dail exercises in a database. Hence, the user cannot retain or access rewrards realted information.
