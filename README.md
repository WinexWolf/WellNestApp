# SRID Starter Code 

This code is written for the Fall 2023 Recitation for CMU's course: 18658 - Software Requirements & Interaction Design. This code will be used for the hands-on demo during the recitation session. ([Slides Here.](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/13THbqFKk8UN3tv0Cx4gYjIgT5fPDfYP9reTJesZ5EzU/edit?usp=sharing 
))

We will be attempting to implement [this Figma Prototype:](https://www.figma.com/file/OEZPp3BOKRW2d8xV4yFBQy/Untitled?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=PUOS9D33g798pmSZ-1)

## Tasks to Complete 
As a part of the demo, we will work on solving 6 tasks that are outlined in `src/app.js`. The solutions to each of these can be found in the respective branches: 

```
master       <-- Contains only the starter code
Checkpoint-1
Checkpoint-2
Checkpoint-3
Checkpoint-4
Checkpoint-5
Checkpoint-6 <-- Contains the complete solution
```
Please attempt each task individually and only refer the solutions if you are stuck. 

## Starter Code Setup

The code in the master branch has been set up using Create React App, as well as the installation and setup docs found on the official Tailwind CSS and Material UI docs. The steps used to setup the starter include: 

1. Bootstrapping the project with ([Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)).
2. Install Material UI ([Docs](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/installation/) )
3. Install Tailwind CSS ([Docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation))
4. Setup Material UI to work with Tailwind CSS ([Docs](https://mui.com/base-ui/guides/working-with-tailwind-css/))
5. Fix a Material UI bug ([StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/75202373/button-in-material-ui-is-transparent-when-loading))
